Usually when Steve steps off a ledge he falls down and gets hurt and when he jumps into water, he sinks unless he starts swimming. Lets write a program that lets Steve automatically build a glass bridge whenever he steps off the ground into water or air. With this new program Steve will never fall or sink. An awesome superpower!\n",

    "We first need to detect if Steve is falling or sinking. How do we do that? As you know, we use blocks for building things in Minecraft. Most of you have built houses and crafted weapons. The secret is that in Minecraft **every** square that is visible is a block. The ground is built from ground blocks and water is built from water blocks. Even air is built from air blocks! That means Steve is going to fall if he is standing on an air block and he will sink if he is on a water block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function **getBlock(x,y,z)** gives us the block at the Minecraft coordinates (x,y,z). Each kind of block has a unique identifier. An air block has an identifier **block.AIR.id** and a water block has an identifier **block.WATER_STATIONARY.id** and **block.WATER_FLOWING.id**. To use these block ids we need to import the block library which has the ids of all the blocks used in Minecraft. \n",

    "\n",
    "The previous task had a lot of statements to figure out if Steve was standing on air or water. We need to use these statements everytime Steve moves to a new position. Wouldn't it be nice if Minecraft had a function just like _postToChat_ that would tell us if Steve was on a air or water block? Unfortunately, Minecraft does not have such a function but you have some superpowers - you can define your own functions! And when you define your own functions, you can use these functions in your programs as you need. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

A function may have no parameters like in **minecraft.Minecraft.create()** or it may have one parameter like **mc.postToChat(\"something useful\")** or it could have many parameters like **max(1,5,2)**. Some functions return values when you call the function. For example, the function **max(1,5,2)** returns the maximum value of the numbers 1,5 and 2. Try it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets write our own fun function :) Remember every function has a **name**, can have zero or more **parameters** and can have a **return value**. Lets define a function named _myCoolFunction_ with one parameter named _n_ that will post the message \"Minecraft rocks times ...\" when you call the function. In Pytho, functiosn are defined using **def** as shown below.\n",
