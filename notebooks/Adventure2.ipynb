We need to store Steve's position when we call the function **getTilePos()** so that we can print the position later. We can use a program **variable** to store the position. A variable has a name and can be used to store values. We'll call our variable **pos** for position and it will contain the Steve's position. When we want to print the position, we print the values of the position x,y and z coordinates using another function **print()** which prints any strings you give it.\n",
